# Dual Runner vs Single Runner: Universal Binary Approaches

This document compares the current single-runner approach with the new dual-runner `lipo -create` approach for building universal binaries.

## Current Approach: Single Runner with CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES

### How it works:
```yaml
runs-on: macos-latest  # GitHub ARM64 runner
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="arm64;x86_64" ..
make
```

### Architecture:
```
[GitHub ARM64 Runner] -> [Universal Binary]
                     |
                     +-> Build both arm64 + x86_64
                     +-> Output: Universal binary
```

## New Approach: Dual Runner with lipo -create

### How it works:
```yaml
# Job 1: ARM64 build
runs-on: macos-latest  # GitHub ARM64 runner
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 ..

# Job 2: x86_64 build  
runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, x64]  # Your Intel Mac
cmake -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=x86_64 ..

# Job 3: Combine
lipo -create -output universal arm64-binary x86_64-binary
```

### Architecture:
```
[GitHub ARM64 Runner] -> [ARM64 Binary] ----+
                                             |
                                             v
                                        [lipo -create] -> [Universal Binary]
                                             ^
                                             |
[Intel Mac Self-hosted] -> [x86_64 Binary] -+
```

## Detailed Comparison

| Aspect | Current (Single Runner) | New (Dual Runner) |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **Build Time** | ⚠️ Slower (sequential cross-compile) | ✅ Faster (parallel native builds) |
| **GitHub Actions Cost** | 💰 Higher (all minutes on GitHub) | 💰 Lower (x86_64 on your hardware) |
| **Debugging** | ❌ Hard to isolate arch issues | ✅ Easy per-architecture debugging |
| **Reliability** | ⚠️ Cross-compilation issues | ✅ Native compilation reliability |
| **Setup Complexity** | ✅ Simple (single runner) | ❌ Complex (self-hosted setup) |
| **Resource Usage** | ❌ GitHub runner does everything | ✅ Distributed across machines |
| **Architecture Separation** | ❌ Same config for both | ✅ Different configs possible |
| **Dependency Management** | ❌ Must be universal | ✅ Can be architecture-specific |
| **Testing** | ❌ Can't test individual archs | ✅ Can test each arch separately |
| **Maintenance** | ✅ Zero maintenance | ❌ Runner maintenance required |

## Performance Analysis

### Current Approach Timing:
```
GitHub Runner (ARM64):
├── Configure CMake (universal): ~2 min
├── Build ARM64 + x86_64: ~15 min
├── Package: ~3 min
└── Total: ~20 min
```

### New Approach Timing:
```
Parallel Jobs:
├── GitHub Runner (ARM64):
│   ├── Configure: ~1 min
│   ├── Build ARM64: ~7 min
│   └── Package: ~1 min
│   └── Subtotal: ~9 min
│
├── Intel Mac (x86_64):
│   ├── Configure: ~1 min  
│   ├── Build x86_64: ~7 min
│   └── Package: ~1 min
│   └── Subtotal: ~9 min
│
└── Combine Job:
    ├── Download artifacts: ~1 min
    ├── lipo -create: ~30 sec
    ├── Code sign: ~1 min
    └── Create DMG: ~2 min
    └── Subtotal: ~5 min

Total: ~14 min (9 min parallel + 5 min sequential)
```

**Result: ~30% faster builds** 🚀

## Reliability Comparison

### Current Issues We've Encountered:
- "bad CPU type in executable" errors
- Cross-compilation Qt framework issues  
- Architecture-specific dependency problems
- Hard to debug which architecture causes issues

### New Approach Benefits:
- Each architecture builds natively (more reliable)
- Easy to isolate problems to specific architecture
- Independent dependency resolution
- Better error messages and debugging

## Cost Analysis

### GitHub Actions Minutes Usage:

**Current Approach:**
```
20 minutes × macOS multiplier (10x) = 200 GitHub minutes per build
```

**New Approach:**
```
GitHub Runner: 9 minutes × 10x = 90 minutes
Intel Mac: 9 minutes × 0x = 0 minutes (your hardware)
Combine Job: 5 minutes × 10x = 50 minutes
Total: 140 GitHub minutes per build
```

**Savings: 30% reduction in GitHub Actions costs** 💰

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Setup (This Week)
1. Set up Intel Mac as self-hosted runner
2. Test the new workflow on a branch
3. Verify universal binaries work correctly

### Phase 2: Parallel Running (Next Week)  
1. Run both workflows in parallel
2. Compare build times and reliability
3. Gather feedback and metrics

### Phase 3: Switch Over (Week 3)
1. Make dual-runner the default for releases
2. Keep single-runner as backup
3. Monitor for any issues

### Phase 4: Optimization (Ongoing)
1. Fine-tune runner performance
2. Add architecture-specific optimizations
3. Implement dependency caching

## Risk Assessment

### Risks of New Approach:
- **Self-hosted runner maintenance**: Need to keep Intel Mac online and updated
- **Network dependency**: Intel Mac needs stable internet
- **Single point of failure**: If Intel Mac is down, no x86_64 builds
- **Security**: Self-hosted runner has repository access

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **Backup runner**: Set up secondary Intel Mac
- **Monitoring**: Add runner health checks
- **Fallback**: Keep single-runner workflow as backup
- **Security**: Use dedicated runner user account

## Recommendation

**Recommended approach: Dual Runner with lipo -create**

### Why:
1. **Better reliability**: Native builds are more reliable than cross-compilation
2. **Cost savings**: 30% reduction in GitHub Actions minutes
3. **Performance**: 30% faster build times  
4. **Debugging**: Much easier to troubleshoot architecture-specific issues
5. **Future-proofing**: Better foundation for additional architectures

### Implementation Plan:
1. Follow `SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP.md` to set up your Intel Mac
2. Test using the new workflow `.github/workflows/dual-runner-universal.yml`
3. Compare results with current approach
4. Switch over once confident in the new system

## Monitoring Success

### Key Metrics to Track:
- **Build success rate**: Should improve with native builds
- **Build time**: Target 30% improvement
- **GitHub Actions cost**: Target 30% reduction  
- **Issue resolution time**: Should be faster with better debugging

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Universal binaries pass all architecture tests
- ✅ Build times under 15 minutes
- ✅ 95%+ build success rate
- ✅ Zero architecture-related issues for 2 weeks
